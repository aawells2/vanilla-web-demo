          <h3>HTML</h3>
          <p>HTML, or HyperText Markup language, defines the <strong>structure</strong> of websites. There are a couple of core concepts
        that you will need to understand as a beginner.</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Semantic Elements</li>
            <li>Block vs Inline Elements</li>
            <li>Forms</li>
            <li>Aria Tags</li>
        </ol>

            <h4>Semantic Elements</h4>
            <p>According to google, semantics are "the branch of linguistics and logic concerned with meaning." <sup>1</sup> For example, angry and furious technically 
                mean the same thing, however, they carry different connotations. The web works in a similar way. </p>

                <p>For example, below are examples of bolded words:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Hello World</strong></li>
                        <li><b>Hello World</b></li>
                    </ul>  
                     Although they look the exact same, they use 
                different html elements to mark them up. To be semantic, in html, is to make it easier for screen readers and other assistive technologies to understand the content. It is therefore
            very important to make sure that our html is semantic</p>

            <h4>Block vs Inline elements</h4>
            <p>Block elements, such as the paragraph tag, take up the entire space in its parent container. Inline Elements only take up the required space. This is important to note 
                when you are styling your website - because it may do something you do not expect.
            </p>

            <h4>Forms</h4>
            <p>Forms are a very common sructure in all websites. Although it may look simple, it is not. Forms can be tricky, especially in later
                chapters, as we explore concepts such as validation.

        <article>
            <h4>Aria Tags</h4>
            <p>Aria (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) are attributes which define more complicated structures.
                For example, structures like accordions and carousels are not HTML elements. These structures make it tricky 
                for screen readers to interact with them properly.
